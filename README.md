# volume cycles

inspired by Mark Wildman's videos about [Volume Cycles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USIGc3yQD7g&t=12s) i built a simple app that let's you configure a series of workouts.

just specify the weights you want to work with, the number of sets you'll cycle through, whether you'll also do a density cycle, the number of reps you'll do, and whether the number of reps is scaled to the weight.
